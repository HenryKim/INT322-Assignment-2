			</header>
			<div>
			<p>HTML Imports, part of the Web Components cast, is a way to include HTML documents in other HTML documents. You're not limited to markup either. 
			An import can also include CSS, JavaScript, or anything else an .html file can contain. In other words, this makes imports a fantastic tool for loading related 
			HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
			<p>
				The URL of an import is called an import location. To load content from another domain, the import location needs to be CORS-enabled:
			</p>
			<p>
				The browser's network stack automatically de-dupes all requests from the same URL. This means that imports that reference the same URL are only retrieved once.
				No matter how many times an import at the same location is loaded, it only executes once.
			</p>
			<p>
				Browser support is still in the early days. Chrome 31 is the first browser to have an implementation. You can enable the flag by turning on Enable HTML 
				Imports in about:flags. For other browsers, Polymer's polyfill works great until things are widely supported.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imports provide convention for bundling HTML/CSS/JS (even other HTML Imports) into a single deliverable. It's an intrinsic feature, but a powerful one. 
				If you're creating a theme, library, or just want to segment your app into logical chunks, giving users a single URL is compelling. 
				Heck, you could even deliver an entire app via an import. Think about that for a second.

			</header>
			<div>
				<p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web and a core technology of the Internet.
				It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created in 1990 and standardized as HTML 4 as of 1997) and, as of December 2012, 
				is a candidate recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest
				multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
				HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
				<p>Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web 
				are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by 
				common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents</p>
				<p> It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more 
				interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs
				) for complex web applications.</p>

			</header>
			<div>
				<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) 
				of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language
				can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>
				<p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.
				This separation can improve content accessibility
				provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content
				(such as by allowing for tableless web design). 
				CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different </p>

				CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, have reinvented the way website designers not only create the look and feel of a website,
				but also how they keep that look consistent throughout the entire website.
				Whether it’s a one page or 100 page website, CSS makes updating each page much simpler. With Cascading Style Sheets,
				a designer has one area or file he/she uses to add pictures, change the font or color of the text, change the background color or
				image and update the entire look of a website.
